## Prediction of Exercise Quality using Wearable Devices.

Over the last few years, there has been a massive increase in the no of gym users using wearable devices such as Fitbit, Jawbone Up and Nike FuelBand. Typically, these are used to quantify the amount of a particular activity done.   

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
